Network-wide process that determines the end-to-end paths that packets take from source to destination
D
The network-wide logic that controls how a datagram is routed among routers along an end to end path from the source host to the destination host
B
A router forwards a packet by examining one or more value in the arriving packet's header and then using these header values to index into its _______________. The value stored in the _________________ for those values indicates the outgoing link interface at that router to which that packet is to be forwarded.
F
The router-local action of transferring a packet from an input link interface to the appropriate output link interface.
C
The Per-Rounter functions in the network layer that determine how a datagram arriving on one of a router's input links if forwarded to one of that router's output links.
A
The controller that computed forwarding tables and interacts with routers is implemented in software. The routing device perfoms forwarding only, while the remote controller computes and distributes forwarding tables.
G
An algorithm which calculates the path taken by packets from sender to receiver. Implemented in the control plane of the network layer.

Network Layer Service Model
A. Network service model\nB. Guarenteed delivery\nC. Guaranteed delivery with bounded delay\nD. In-order packet delivery\nE. Guaranteed minimal bandwidth\nF. Security (as a network layer service)\nG. Best-effort Service
This service not only guarantees delivery of the packet. but delivery within a specified host-to-host delay bound
C
The network layer could encrypt all datagrams at the source and decrypt them at the destination, providing confidentiality to all transport-layer segments
F
packets are neither guaranteed to be received in the order which they were sent, nor is their eventual delivery even guaranteed.
G
This service guarantees that packets arrive at the destination in the order that they were sent
D
This service guarantees that a packet sent by a source host will enventually arrice at the destination host
B
Defines the characteristics of end-to-end delivery of packets between sending and reveiving hosts
A
This service emulates the behavior of a transmission link of a specified bit rate between sending and reveiving hosts. As long as the sending hosts transmits bits at a rate below the specified bit rate, than all packets are eventually delivered to the destination host
